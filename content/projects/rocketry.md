The NEAR (Near-sonic Experimental Airbrakes Rocket) team at DARE aims to design and construct a rocket to reach an apogee of 3.5km. To allow for a precise altitude target, an experimental AAC (Active Apogee Control) system is being developed, consisting of an airbrake mechanism and control software. The team currently consists of 16 students, and is aiming to launch at the end of this 2022.

Our rocket is a 2.4m x ø150mm pressure-fed liquid bi-propellant rocket that uses ethanol as  its fuel and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer. With a 1.2kN engine and 20s of burn time the rocket will reach a target apogee of 9km.

Implementing the use of 3D printed parts the rocket  eliminates entire sub-assemblies and allows for a level of system integration and mass reduction that would otherwise not be possible.

Aside from the stainless steel fuel tanks, the structure of the the rocket is composed primarily of carbon fibre.

tratos is the flagship project of DARE. Many years of knowledge and research are combined into a single, ambitious project. Stratos V strives to fly DARE’s first-ever cryogenic rocket.
 

We rely on the knowledge gathered during the four previous Stratos projects. A two-stage solid rocket, Stratos I, was launched in 2009 to an altitude of 12.5 km, setting the European Altitude Record. Stratos II+, a hybrid rocket launched in October 2015, broke our own altitude record at 21.5km. Stratos III was launched in the Summer of 2018, aiming even higher than the last altitude record. Unfortunately, an anomaly occurred 20 seconds after the launch, resulting in the loss of the vehicle. Stratos IV was intended to launch in the Fall of 2021.  However, despite our best efforts, ground system difficulties prevented the launch from taking place.
