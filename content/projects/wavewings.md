Climate change is currently one of the greatest societal problems. Electricity generation is a large emitter of greenhouses gases, thus being a major contributor to climate change. It is imperative to expand renewable energy sources, such as wind and wave energy. Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is a promising new technology to produce renewable electricity, especially in areas where conventional wind turbines struggle, such as deep offshore. The WaveWings project aims to combine wave energy converters and airborne wind energy in order to capture possible synergies.
