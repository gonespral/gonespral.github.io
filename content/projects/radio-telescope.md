# Tiny Radio Telescope

A tiny homemade radio telescope I built which can take pictures IN RADIO... I guess I was just bored.

## Description

The aim of this project was to build a radio telescope using a small satellite dish, which can scan its surroundings and create an image representing the intensity of the radio in different areas of the sky. I was inspired to create this project after watching a video by "The Thought Emporium" (there's a link at the bottom of the details page), where he shows how he built a radio telescope at home. My radio telescope is different from this one, and I used my own design and wrote my own code to control the dish and receive radio data, but the idea is more or less the same. I finished this project a few months ago and decided to post it here to see what people think, and to help anyone who wants to build their own radio telescope.

I consider this project more of an experiment, to see what kind of data I could collect with a simple homemade setup. It is fascinating to think about all the information we can gather from space using just radio waves.
