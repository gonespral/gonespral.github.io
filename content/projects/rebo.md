Project REBO is a robotic solution to beverage can collection and recycling, created as part of the [Robotics Minor at TU Delft](https://robohouse.nl/madein/minor-robotics-2023-2024/), and commissioned by [TechTics](https://www.techtics.team/).

Meet REBO, our innovative solution developed for [TechTics](https://www.techtics.team/) to combat drinking can littering and promote recycling. REBO, a versatile robot designed to engage users with its interactive design, collects, crushes, and stores aluminum beverage cans while returning the Statiegeld (government deposit) to customers, incentivizing recycling on the spot.
