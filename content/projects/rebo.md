Project REBO is a robotic solution to beverage can collection and recycling, created as part of the [Robotics Minor at TU Delft](https://robohouse.nl/madein/minor-robotics-2023-2024/), and commissioned by [TechTics](https://www.techtics.team/). The robot designed to engage users with its interactive design, collect, crush, and store aluminum beverage cans while returning the [Statiegeld](https://www.statiegeldnederland.nl/) (government deposit) to customers, incentivizing recycling on the spot.

Unfortunately, details of the project are under wraps, but I can share some pictures of the project below:
